# Tensor_Flow

I'm still working on the front end interaction shell for the course feedback web-scraping project. But I plan to finish (or step away for a bit) when 
July 2022 ends and start playing with TensorFlow! This repository is to remind me to get started come August, but I doubt I'll need the reminder. I'm
SUPER excited to be diving deeper into the math behind machine learning this year in school and want to start playing with the application side ASAP!

Anyways, more to come as I do some tutorials and invent a project for this.
