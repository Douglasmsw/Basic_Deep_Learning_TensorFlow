# Tensor_Flow

Working full-time slowed my pace with the webscraping projects but now that it is done... AUGUST IS TENSORFLOW MONTH! <\br>
I'm super excited to play around with some machine learning packages. I am going to be spending a lot of time on the math behind machine learning <\br>
but don't want to wait until my later courses before working with these fun tools. <\br>
<\br>
I will be posting tutorials and small projects in this repository as I go, with the hope to do a larger project / analysis before school starts <\br>
back up in later September.
